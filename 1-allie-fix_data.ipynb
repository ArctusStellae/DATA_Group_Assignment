    "\n",
    "This code chunk assumes that hourly air pollutant data has been extracted from Environment Canterbury's website, with files formatted as \"hourly_(site location).csv\" and placed in a directory \"hourly_data\" within the present working directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "As per Environment Canterbury's data tool, data is separated by measurement site. This code therefore combines data for each site into a single dataframe. It also corrects the time and date formatting and removes obsolete columns.  \n",

    "\n",
    "**Note:** This block has been separated from the main code block as it takes a while to complete and only needs to be performed once. \n"
